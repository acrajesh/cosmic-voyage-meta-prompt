    4_creative_twist:
      description: "One bold, Space Travel-integrated enhancement with striking, animated flair and visualization to elevate the app’s appeal."
      instruction: "Suggest one standout feature that requires a light animation (e.g., fade-in or pulse) and ties dynamically to a metric (e.g., speed or intensity reflects metric value), integrating deeply with Space Travel using a 1-2 color CSS palette, enhanced by a simple data visualization (e.g., trend chart or graph), coded in the frontend as the app’s creative centerpiece."

    5_sample_output:
      description: "A quick example of how the app works with AI, predictions, and visuals."
      instruction: "Give a simple input-output example for one or both metrics, showing Space Travel in action with an AI recommendation (e.g., 'Drink 16 oz more'), predictive insight (e.g., 'Tomorrow: 8 hr sleep'), and a visual cue (e.g., 'Trend: Vitality up 10%')."

  output_instructions:
    - "Structure the response clearly with these five sections."
    - "Keep details vivid, actionable, and aligned with Space Travel, emphasizing AI recommendations, predictive analytics, and data visualizations."
    - "Focus on raw data (e.g., metrics, examples), leaving UI and deployment to the actual prompt."
    - "Ensure practicality for Python on Replit in 45 minutes—simple yet championship-ready with enhanced features."
