# Dubai to the Stars – The Ultimate Space Travel Experience

The future of travel is here! Imagine Dubai as the world’s first hub for commercial space travel. Your challenge is to code a platform that allows users to book and manage space station trips, check schedules, compare prices, and even find accommodation in space.

## Championship Challenge Brief

**Your Challenge:** Develop a functional prototype of a space travel booking platform with the following features:

- **Trip Scheduling & Booking**  
  Allow users to choose departure dates, destinations (space stations, lunar hotels, etc.), and seat classes.

- **Pricing & Packages**  
  Display different travel options—luxury cabins, economy shuttles, and VIP zero-gravity experiences.

- **Accommodation Recommendations**  
  Suggest space hotels or orbital stations based on user preferences.

- **User Dashboard**  
  A profile page where travelers can manage their bookings, see countdown timers for launch, and get AI-based travel tips.
