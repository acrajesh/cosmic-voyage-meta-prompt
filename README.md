# Cosmic Voyage – Meta-Prompt to MVP 🚀

**Live App:** [Cosmic Voyage on Replit](https://83aee243-4459-4011-8303-d7bec86004e4-00-7mirjy2k5xid.worf.replit.dev/)  

This project shows how a simple curiosity — *can I really ship something with just a meta-prompt and a prompt?* — turned into a working minimum viable product.

## 🌀 What’s Inside

- **Meta-Prompt** (the blueprint) → defines role, context, output format, and constraints.  
- **Prompt** (one-liner) → generated from the meta-prompt.  
- **Live App** → a Replit-hosted web app built from the prompt output.
